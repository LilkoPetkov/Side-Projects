The script is made to provide a fast and easy search and replace feature for WordPress ONLY websites. 

Please be careful with the CSS replacements, as this can affect the website negatively and break the setup.

Before any changes, it is advisable to create a full backup of the website's files. The script will create a database backup itself, if requested.
